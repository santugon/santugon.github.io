In line with this and in collaboration with the OVPIA, we aim to establish a centralized excused absences manual that provides students a consolidated set of instructions on how to file for an excused absence, containing detailed procedures and information per college. Not only will students who aren't familiar with the process and procedures benefit from the manual, they are able to take care of their health by reducing the steps needed to apply for an absence.\n",title:"Excused Absences Manual"},{desc:"Preparation for the return of face-to-face classes without properly assessing the current situation will place the Lasallian community at risk.

The health and safety of the Lasallian community should be of utmost priority and the forefront of the transition.
